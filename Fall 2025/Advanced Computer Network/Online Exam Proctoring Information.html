Monitoring is only active during an assessment.</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable with the use of Lockdown Browser in your home (or other private spaces), or installing Lockdown Browseron your personal computer, you should plan to complete software-proctored assignments and tests on a University-owned computer in a University computer lab. Optional pen-and-paper assessments may be available to students who opt-out of software proctoring. It is the student’s responsibility to notify me in writing at least twenty-four hours before a scheduled event if they wish to opt-out. Students who do not opt-out in a timely manner may choose to complete the software-proctored assessment, or accept an incomplete/zero for the assessment.</p>
<p>To complete a software-proctored assignment or exam, you must have a reasonably modern computer with a functioning webcam, microphone, and internet access. If you do not have suitable technology, you should arrange to complete the assessment in a University computer lab.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Consult University Policy No. 2360 for complete details about the University’s use of software proctoring.</em></p></body></html>
